# RhaetianRailwayRework

This project was made in CZE + CH hackathon organised by SIT Port. The projects goal was to optimize and make Rhaetian railways website more user friendly for tourists. Here, in this readme, you will find everything that we managed to improve on the hackathon.

We also took inspiration from other railway companies like ÄŒD, Deutsche Bahn and SBB.

Things that were not functioning properly:
1. Translation system was broken - `On some pages, we found that sometimes the translation would default us back to english.`
2.  Too many redirects, sumbdomains, etc. - `Website should not have that many redirects to too many subdomains, because customers tend to get lost, we recommend reducing the number to only one or two pages.`
3. Inconsistent website styling - `For better orientation and experience for the user, we also recommend to have more consistent styling in pages.`
4. Other errors - `Sometimes, we got redirected to a page with no CSS or common errors that led to reduced functionality of the page.`
